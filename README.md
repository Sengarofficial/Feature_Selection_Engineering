# Feature_Selection_Engineering:

In machine learning , independent feature ----> dependent feature ( directly proportional). now if two independent feature , highlye correlated with each other (directly proportional ) then both are producing the same effect on the dependent feature. so we should use either of them because if we use both independent feature which are highly correlated with each then machine learning algorithm will move through curse of dimensionality.

wherever we have independent features they should not be inter-dependent with each other. all independent feature should be independent with each others and only dependent on dependent feature ( target variable ).

Note: We should keep those independent features which are "inversely proportional" to each other and "negatively correlated" with each other.
